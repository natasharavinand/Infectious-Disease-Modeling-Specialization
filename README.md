# Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Specialization

Infectious Disease Modeling Specialization offered by Imperial College London through Coursera. Mathematical modelling is increasingly being used to support public health decision-making in the control of infectious diseases. This specialisation aims to introduce some fundamental concepts of mathematical modelling with all modelling conducted in the programming language R - a widely used application today. Includes the basic theory of infectious disease modelling alongside practical, hands-on experience of coding models.
